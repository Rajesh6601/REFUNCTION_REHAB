## 2. Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice |
|---|---|
| **Frontend** | React 18 + Vite |
| **Styling** | Tailwind CSS + custom CSS variables |
| **Routing** | React Router v6 |
| **Forms** | React Hook Form + Zod validation |

| **Auth** | JWT + bcrypt (staff/admin login) |

### Database via Docker (No Local Installation Required)

**CRITICAL RULE**: PostgreSQL must NEVER require a manual local installation. It is always run via Docker using the official image from Docker Hub. This makes the project work identically on any developer machine or cloud VM.

**`docker-compose.yml`** (at project root):
```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  db:
    image: postgres:16-alpine
    container_name: refunction_db
    restart: always
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${DB_USER:-refunction}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${DB_PASSWORD:-rehab_secret}
      POSTGRES_DB: ${DB_NAME:-refunction_rehab}
    ports:
      - "${DB_PORT:-5432}:5432"
    volumes:
      - postgres_data:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U ${DB_USER:-refunction}"]
      interval: 10s
      timeout: 5s
      retries: 5

  server:
    build: ./server
    container_name: refunction_server
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      db:
        condition: service_healthy
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgresql://${DB_USER:-refunction}:${DB_PASSWORD:-rehab_secret}@db:5432/${DB_NAME:-refunction_rehab}
      JWT_SECRET: ${JWT_SECRET}
      RAZORPAY_KEY_ID: ${RAZORPAY_KEY_ID}
      RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET: ${RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET}
      SMTP_HOST: ${SMTP_HOST}
      SMTP_USER: ${SMTP_USER}
      SMTP_PASS: ${SMTP_PASS}
      CLOUDINARY_URL: ${CLOUDINARY_URL}
      PORT: 4000
    ports:
      - "4000:4000"

  client:
    build: ./client
    container_name: refunction_client
    restart: always
    depends_on:
      - server
    ports:
      - "80:80"

volumes:
  postgres_data:
```

**`server/Dockerfile`**:
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production
COPY . .
RUN npx prisma generate
EXPOSE 4000
CMD ["sh", "-c", "npx prisma migrate deploy && node index.js"]
```

**`client/Dockerfile`** (production):
```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine AS build
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/dist /usr/share/nginx/html
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
EXPOSE 80
```

**`client/nginx.conf`**:
```nginx
server {
  listen 80;
  root /usr/share/nginx/html;
  index index.html;

  location / {
    try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html;
  }

  location /api/ {
    proxy_pass http://server:4000;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
  }
}
```

**`.env.example`** (at project root — copy to `.env` and fill in secrets):
```env
# Database (used by Docker Compose)
DB_USER=refunction
DB_PASSWORD=rehab_secret
DB_NAME=refunction_rehab
DB_PORT=5432

# Set automatically by Docker Compose for the server container
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://refunction:rehab_secret@db:5432/refunction_rehab

# Auth
JWT_SECRET=change_this_to_a_long_random_secret

# Razorpay
RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=

# Email
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASS=

# Cloudinary
CLOUDINARY_URL=
```

**One-command startup (local dev)**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env        # fill in secrets
docker compose up --build   # pulls postgres:16-alpine, builds server + client, runs migrations
```

**Prisma workflow inside Docker**:
- `npx prisma migrate deploy` runs automatically on server container start (via CMD in Dockerfile)
- To run migrations manually during dev: `docker compose exec server npx prisma migrate dev`
- To open Prisma Studio: `docker compose exec server npx prisma studio`

### Cloud Deployment

The same `docker-compose.yml` works on any cloud VM (AWS EC2, GCP Compute Engine, DigitalOcean Droplet, etc.) without modification:

```bash
# On any cloud VM with Docker installed:
git clone <repo>
cd refunction-rehab
cp .env.example .env   # set production secrets
docker compose up -d   # runs in background, postgres data persists in named volume
```

**Managed cloud DB option** (recommended for production):
For platforms like Railway, Render, AWS RDS, Supabase, or Neon — simply override `DATABASE_URL` in the environment and remove the `db` service from `docker-compose.yml`. The server and client containers remain identical.

```env
# Example: Using Supabase / Neon / Railway Postgres
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/dbname?sslmode=require
```

Prisma handles both local Docker Postgres and managed cloud Postgres identically — no code changes required.

### Data Persistence Rules (CRITICAL)
- Every patient enrollment form submission MUST be saved to the `Patient` table via `POST /api/patients/enroll`.
- Every payment recorded MUST be saved to the `Payment` table via `POST /api/payments`.
- Every contact form submission MUST be saved to the `ContactInquiry` table via `POST /api/contact`.
- PostgreSQL data persists across container restarts via the `postgres_data` named Docker volume.
- The frontend must call real API endpoints — **no `console.log` placeholders** in production code.
- On enrollment success, return the generated Patient ID to the frontend and display it to the user.
- **Enrollment and payment are independent operations.** Enrollment creates a `Patient` record without requiring any payment. Payments are linked to patients via `patientId` but are created as separate records at any time after enrollment. A patient may have zero, one, or many associated payments.
- **Pending payment tracking must include enrolled-but-unpaid patients.** A patient who has enrolled but has zero `Payment` records is considered to have a pending payment. The dashboard's "Pending Payments" count and the admin patients table must account for these patients — not only patients with a `Payment` record in `partial` or `pending` status.

- Submit button → POST to `/api/patients/enroll`

On success: show confirmation card + option to "Proceed to Payment"

> **Enroll Now, Pay Later**: Payment is **not** mandatory at enrollment time. Patients receive their Patient ID immediately upon successful enrollment. Payment can be made at any later time via the `/payment` page by searching with Patient ID or mobile number. Staff can also record payments later from the admin dashboard (`/admin/payments`). The "Proceed to Payment" link on the success screen is a convenience shortcut — not a required step.

---

### 4.3 Payment Collection Page (`/payment`)

> **Independent of Enrollment**: The payment page operates independently and is accessible at any time — not only immediately after enrollment. Staff can open `/payment` directly, look up any existing patient by Patient ID or mobile number, and record a payment. This makes deferred "pay later" workflows seamless. Multiple payments over time for the same patient are fully supported (session-wise billing), since the `Patient → Payment` relationship is one-to-many.

Based on the Patient Payment Collection Form PDF:

**Section 1 — Patient Lookup**
- Search by Patient ID or Mobile Number

- Default rate: ₹600 per session
- Sub Total, GST (if applicable), Package Discount (if applicable, shown in green), **TOTAL AMOUNT PAYABLE** (large, bold)

**Section 3 — Payment Mode**

## 8. Design Rules

1. **Navy + Teal + Orange** are the three core colors — every page must use all three meaningfully.
2. All CTA buttons: orange `#E8630A` with white text, rounded-full, hover scale-105.
3. Section alternation: white bg → light blue `#F0F6FA` → navy → repeat.
4. Cards: white, rounded-2xl, subtle shadow, hover lift (translateY -4px).
5. All icons from **Lucide React** — never use emoji as UI icons.
6. Mobile-first responsive — clinic patients may be elderly; font-size minimum 16px body, 14px labels.
7. Floating WhatsApp button always visible on mobile and desktop.
8. Form validation errors: red border + inline message below field.
9. Page transitions: Framer Motion `AnimatePresence` fade.
10. Loading states: skeleton loaders (not spinners) for data-fetching sections.

## 10. Key Implementation Notes

- **Enrollment**: The `/enroll` page uses a custom multi-step React form (4 steps: Personal, Contact, Program, Goals). All data is stored directly in the PostgreSQL database. Google Form integration has been removed.

- **Payment**: Integrate Razorpay for online payments. For cash/cheque, staff records manually via admin dashboard.

- **Receipt PDF**: Use `@react-pdf/renderer` to generate receipts server-side matching the official format from the PDF.

- **WhatsApp CTA**: All "Contact" buttons should open `https://wa.me/919900911795` with a pre-filled message: "Hi Dr. Neha, I'd like to book a physiotherapy session."

- **Admin / Doctor Dashboard** (protected, `/admin`): Accessible only after staff/doctor login with JWT. Must show real data fetched from the database:
  - **Overview cards**: Total patients enrolled, new today, new this month, total revenue, revenue today, pending payments count.
  - **Patient table** (`/admin/patients`): Full list with name, phone, program, enrollment date, status. Searchable, filterable by program and date. Exportable to CSV.
  - **Payment table** (`/admin/payments`): All payment records with patient name, amount, mode, status, date. Filterable by status and date range. Revenue totals shown. Exportable to CSV.
  - **Recent activity feed**: Last 10 enrollments and last 10 payments on the dashboard home.
  - **Payment mode breakdown**: Pie/bar chart showing Cash vs UPI vs Card vs Cheque split.

- **Environment variables needed**:
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=
  RAZORPAY_KEY_ID=
  RAZORPAY_KEY_SECRET=
  JWT_SECRET=
  SMTP_HOST=
  SMTP_USER=
  SMTP_PASS=
  CLOUDINARY_URL=
  ```

## 12. Quick-Start Build Order

When building this app from scratch, follow this order:

1. **Docker setup**: Write `docker-compose.yml`, `server/Dockerfile`, `client/Dockerfile`, `nginx.conf`, `.env.example`
2. **Verify DB**: `docker compose up db` — confirm postgres:16-alpine pulls and starts cleanly
3. **Backend scaffold**: Express server + Prisma schema + `prisma migrate dev` inside container
4. **All API routes**: patients, payments, contact, auth, admin — all wired to Prisma/PostgreSQL
5. **Frontend setup**: Vite + React + Tailwind + Framer Motion + React Router
6. **Layout**: Navbar (with logo) + Footer + FloatingWhatsApp
7. **Homepage**: Hero → Services strip → Feature blocks → CTA banner
8. **Services pages**: One template, render per service
9. **Enrollment form**: Multi-step form → POST to `/api/patients/enroll` → save to DB
10. **Payment page**: Dynamic payment mode forms + fee table → POST to `/api/payments` → save to DB
11. **Wire all forms to API**: No `console.log` — every submission hits the real endpoint
12. **Admin/Doctor Dashboard**: Login → JWT auth → patient table, payment table, revenue stats from DB
13. **Razorpay**: Online payment integration
14. **PDF receipt**: react-pdf receipt generator
15. **Export**: CSV download for patients and payments
16. **Full Docker test**: `docker compose up --build` — entire stack runs from one command, no local DB needed
17. **Polish**: Animations, mobile responsiveness, loading states, skeleton loaders

## 13. Doctor Dashboard — Page Specifications (`/admin`)

### 13.1 Login (`/admin/login`)
- Email + Password form → POST `/api/auth/login` → store JWT in localStorage
- Redirect to `/admin/dashboard` on success
- All `/admin/*` routes are protected — redirect to `/admin/login` if no valid JWT

### 13.2 Dashboard Home (`/admin/dashboard`)

**Month Picker** (top-right corner):
- Left/right arrows to navigate between months (← January 2026 →)
- Defaults to the current month on load
- Cannot navigate beyond the current month (next button disabled)
- When month changes, the dashboard re-fetches data with `?month=X&year=YYYY` query params
- Monthly stat card labels update dynamically: "Patients — This Month" or "Patients — March 2026"

**Stat Cards Row** (4-column grid):
- Total Patients Enrolled (all time)
- New Patients Today
- Patients — {selected month} (enrolled in selected month)
- Total Revenue (all time, ₹)
- Revenue Today (₹)
- Revenue — {selected month} (₹) — revenue for the selected month
- Pending Payments (count + ₹ value) — **must include** patients who enrolled but have zero payment records (not just payments with `partial`/`pending` status). Count = patients with no payments + payment records in `partial`/`pending` status.
- Active Packages (count of packages with `status: "active"`)
- Visits Today (count of visits recorded today)

**Packages Needing Attention** (shown only when packages have ≤2 sessions remaining):
- Table: Patient Name | Package | Sessions Used | Remaining | Action (View link to patient profile)

**Recent Enrollments Table** (last 10):
- Patient Name | Program | Session Type | Enrolled At | Actions (View)

**Recent Payments Table** (last 10):
- Patient Name | Amount (₹) | Mode | Status | Date | Actions (Receipt)

**Payment Mode Breakdown Chart:**
- Bar or donut chart — Cash / UPI / Card / Net Banking / Cheque counts and totals

### 13.3 Patients Page (`/admin/patients`)
- Search bar (name / phone / patient ID)
- Filter: Program type, Enrollment date range
- Paginated table: ID | Name | Age | Gender | Mobile | Program | Session Type | Enrolled At | Payment Status | Pkg Status | Actions
- **Payment Status column**: Show a badge per patient — green "X paid" if they have payment records, amber "No payment" if they have zero payment records. This gives staff immediate visibility into who has enrolled but not yet paid.
- **Pkg Status column**: Shows the patient's active package progress — green "Active (4/10)" badge for active packages, or grey "No package" if none. **Clicking the badge opens the Packages & Visits modal** (see Section 16.7). Data comes from the `packages` field returned by the admin patients query (active packages only, with visit counts).
- Actions: **Edit** (links to `/admin/patients/:id/edit` — implemented), **Visits** (opens Packages & Visits modal — same as clicking the Pkg Status badge), **Payment** (links to `/payment?patientId={id}` for quick deferred payment recording)
- **Export to CSV** button (calls `GET /api/admin/patients/export`)
- Total count shown: "Showing X of Y patients"

### 13.4 Payments Page (`/admin/payments`)
- Filter: Payment status (Paid / Partial / Pending / Refund), Date range, Payment mode
- Paginated table: Receipt No. | Patient | Services | Amount (₹) | Mode | Status | Date | Actions
- Actions: View receipt, Download PDF receipt
- **Revenue Summary bar** at top: Total Collected | Pending | Refunded
- **Export to CSV** button (calls `GET /api/admin/payments/export`)

## 14. Visual Content & Imagery

The portal includes relevant photographs and images to make it more appealing, relatable, and trustworthy for patients.

### Current Image Mapping (`client/src/lib/images.js`)

| Key | File | Used For |
|---|---|---|
| `hero` | `/images/pic-6.png` | Homepage hero — Dr. Neha's photo |
| `seniors` | `/images/pic-1.jpeg` | Senior Care — home page & service detail |
| `painManagement` | `/images/pic-2.jpeg` | Pain Management — home page & service detail |
| `clinic` | `/images/pic-3.jpeg` | Sports Injury Rehab — service card & detail |
| `womensHealth` | `/images/pic-4.jpeg` | Women's Health — home page & service detail |
| `womensHealth2` | `/images/pic-5.jpeg` | Women's Health (alternate) |
| `kids` | `/images/pic-7.jpeg` | Kids Exercise — service card & detail |
| `postSurgery` | `/images/pic-8.jpeg` | Post-Surgery Rehab — service card & detail |

### Image Display Rules

All images are **portrait-oriented** (1024×1536px, 2:3 ratio). Display rules:

- **Home page feature blocks**: Rendered as plain `<motion.img>` at full width with natural height — no `object-cover` or forced aspect ratio. No cropping, no gaps.
- **Service cards** (Services.jsx): Fixed height `h-48` with `object-cover` — slight crop is acceptable for uniform grid thumbnails.
- **Service detail pages**: Rendered as plain `<motion.img>` at full width with natural height — same as home page.
- **Hero backgrounds**: Used at 20% opacity as a background overlay behind the gradient.

### Image Guidelines
- **Prefer real clinic photos** over stock images whenever possible — authenticity builds trust
- All images should be **optimized for web** (compressed, lazy-loaded)
- Use **alt text** for accessibility (e.g., "Senior patient performing guided knee strengthening exercise")
- Images are portrait (2:3) — never force them into landscape containers with `object-cover` as this crops important text overlays
- Store images in `/client/public/images/`
- Additional raw images available in `/client/img/` (pic-1 through pic-8)

### Service Detail Page Layout

Each service detail page has a **two-column layout** (`lg:grid-cols-2`, `items-start`):

**Left column**: Tagline, full-width image (natural height), description text, "What We Treat" checklist, CTA buttons.

**Right column** (3 stacked cards):
1. **Your Treatment Journey** — 5-step numbered journey with service-colored step badges
2. **Why Choose Us** — 4 service-specific highlights on a gradient background (navy → service color)
3. **Session Details** — Duration, frequency, mode + "Book via WhatsApp" button

---

## 15. Patient Testimonials Feature

Patient testimonials build trust and provide social proof. Since healthcare decisions are deeply personal, hearing from real patients who recovered from similar conditions significantly boosts enrollment confidence.

### 15.1 Homepage Testimonials Section

Placed between the Feature Blocks and CTA Banner on the homepage.

**Layout:**
- Section heading: "What Our Patients Say" with subtitle "Real stories from real patients"
- **Carousel/slider** of 3–4 featured testimonials (auto-scroll with pause on hover)
- Each card shows: star rating, quote excerpt (2–3 lines), patient name or initials, condition treated, outcome
- "View All Testimonials →" link to `/testimonials`
- Background: light (`bg-light`) to contrast with white feature blocks above

**Design:**
- Cards: white, rounded-2xl, shadow, with a large teal quote icon (`"`) at top-left
- Star rating: gold stars using Lucide `Star` icon
- Patient identity: Name or initials + age range + condition badge
- Outcome badge: green pill showing result (e.g., "Pain-free in 6 weeks")

### 15.2 Testimonials Page (`/testimonials`)

Dedicated page showing all approved testimonials.

**Layout:**
- Hero: gradient banner with heading "Patient Success Stories"
- Filter tabs: All | Seniors | Women's Health | Pain Management | Sports Injury | Post-Surgery | Kids
- Grid of testimonial cards (2 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile)
- Each card shows full review text, star rating, patient name/initials, condition, service, treatment duration, outcome
- Video testimonials: embedded YouTube player or play button overlay if `videoUrl` is present
- Pagination or "Load More" for large lists

**Data:** Fetched from `GET /api/testimonials` (only approved testimonials returned)

### 15.3 Admin Testimonials Management (`/admin/testimonials`)

Protected page for Dr. Neha / staff to manage testimonials.

**Features:**
- **Add Testimonial** button → modal/form with fields:
  - Patient Name*, Patient Initials (optional), Age, Gender
  - Condition Treated*, Service Category* (dropdown: seniors, womens-health, pain-management, sports-rehab, post-surgery, kids)
  - Rating* (1–5 star selector)
  - Review Text* (textarea)
  - Treatment Duration (e.g., "3 months")
  - Outcome (e.g., "Pain-free", "Walking independently")
  - Video URL (optional YouTube/Vimeo link)
  - Patient Photo URL (optional)
  - Consent checkbox (mandatory)
- **Table view** of all testimonials: Patient Name | Condition | Rating | Status (Approved/Pending) | Featured | Date | Actions
- **Actions per testimonial**: Edit, Approve/Reject toggle, Feature/Unfeature toggle, Delete
- **Bulk actions**: Approve selected, Delete selected
- Status badge: Green "Approved", Amber "Pending", Red "Rejected"

**Workflow:**
1. Dr. Neha or staff adds a testimonial after getting verbal/written consent from patient
2. Testimonial is created with `isApproved: false` by default
3. Staff reviews and toggles `isApproved: true` to make it public
4. Optionally marks as `isFeatured: true` to show on homepage carousel

### 15.4 Privacy & Consent Rules

- **Patient consent is mandatory** — the `consentGiven` field must be `true` before a testimonial can be approved
- Patients can choose to display their **full name, first name only, or just initials** — the `patientInitials` field provides anonymity
- **No medical records or identifiable health data** beyond what the patient consents to share
- Age is optional and displayed as a range (e.g., "60s") not exact age
- Photo is optional and only used with explicit consent
- Staff should **never fabricate testimonials** — all must come from real patients

### 15.5 Service Detail Page Integration

Each service detail page should show 1–2 relevant testimonials at the bottom (above the CTA banner), filtered by the service slug. This gives contextual social proof — a patient viewing "Physiotherapy for Seniors" sees testimonials from other seniors.

**Implementation:** Filter from `GET /api/testimonials?service={slug}&limit=2&featured=true`

---

## 16. Patient Visit Tracking & Package Management

Track the number of visits a patient has completed against their purchased treatment package. This helps Dr. Neha know exactly where each patient stands — how many sessions are done, how many remain, and when a renewal is due.

**Integration philosophy:** This feature is NOT a standalone system. It plugs into the existing Patient, Payment, and Dashboard modules — a package is born from a Payment, visits are tracked inside the existing patient profile page, and stats appear on the existing dashboard.

### 16.1 Why This Matters

- **For the doctor/clinic:** Quick visibility into each patient's attendance, avoids over- or under-servicing, and enables timely package renewal conversations.
- **For the patient:** Transparency on sessions used vs. remaining — no confusion or disputes.

### 16.2 Package & Visit Data Model

Add to the Prisma schema (Section 6). The `TreatmentPackage` links to both `Patient` and `Payment` — no duplicate amount/patient fields.

```prisma
model TreatmentPackage {
  id            String   @id @default(cuid())
  patientId     String
  patient       Patient  @relation(fields: [patientId], references: [id])
  paymentId     String
  payment       Payment  @relation(fields: [paymentId], references: [id])
  packageName   String            // e.g., "10-Day Physiotherapy Package"
  totalSessions Int               // e.g., 10

**Required relation updates to existing models (Section 6):**

```prisma
// Add to existing Patient model:
model Patient {
  // ... existing fields ...
  payments          Payment[]
  packages          TreatmentPackage[]   // ← NEW
}

// Add to existing Payment model:
model Payment {
  // ... existing fields ...
  package           TreatmentPackage?    // ← NEW (one-to-one: a payment may or may not create a package)
}
```

### 16.3 Integration with Payment Form (`/payment`)

The existing Payment page (Section 4.5 / `Payment.jsx`) gets a **package toggle** — no separate package creation page needed.

#### Changes to Payment Form

**Default session rate:** ₹600 per session (applies to initial line item and newly added service lines).

After the **Service Details** section, add:

- **"Package Payment"** toggle with teal icon (default: off)
- When toggled ON:
  - The first line item's **quantity auto-syncs** to the selected session count (e.g., selecting 10-Session Package sets qty=10, so total becomes 10 × ₹600 = ₹6,000)
  - Reveal package-specific fields:
    - **Package Type** — dropdown of common presets:
      - 5-Session Package (qty → 5)
      - 10-Session Package (qty → 10)
      - 15-Session Package (qty → 15)
      - Monthly Unlimited (qty → 30)
      - Custom (manual qty entry)
    - **Total Sessions** — number input (auto-filled from preset, editable; also syncs line item qty)
    - **Package Discount (₹)** — flat discount amount subtracted from the total (e.g., ₹6,000 - ₹1,000 discount = ₹5,000). Shown as a green "Package Discount -₹X" line in the totals breakdown. Resets to 0 when toggle is turned off.
    - **Expiry Date** — optional date picker (package validity window)
    - **Package Notes** — optional text
- When toggled OFF, line item qty resets to 1 and package discount resets to 0
- On payment submission (`POST /api/payments`), if the package toggle is ON, the backend **automatically creates a `TreatmentPackage`** linked to the new payment record using `prisma.$transaction()`. No separate API call needed from the frontend.

#### Totals Breakdown (when package is active with discount)

```
Subtotal                    ₹6,000
GST (if applicable)         ₹0
Package Discount            -₹1,000    ← green text, only shown when discount > 0
─────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                       ₹5,000
```

#### Flow Example

1. Patient RF-0012 comes in, wants a 10-session package for ₹6,000 with ₹1,000 discount
2. Staff opens `/payment?patientId=RF-0012`
3. Toggles ON **"Package Payment"**
4. Selects preset "10-Session Package" → totalSessions auto-fills to 10, line item qty auto-updates to 10, subtotal shows ₹6,000
5. Enters Package Discount: ₹1,000 → total updates to ₹5,000
6. Clicks **Save Record**
7. Backend creates the Payment (₹5,000) AND the TreatmentPackage (10 sessions) in one atomic transaction

### 16.4 API Routes

| Method | Route | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| GET    | `/api/admin/packages?patientId={id}` | List all packages for a patient (with visit counts) |
| GET    | `/api/admin/packages/:id` | Get package details with all visits |
| PATCH  | `/api/admin/packages/:id` | Update package (status, notes, expiry) |
| POST   | `/api/admin/packages/:id/visits` | Record a new visit (auto-increments visitNumber) |
| DELETE | `/api/admin/packages/:id/visits/:visitId` | Remove a wrongly recorded visit |

**Note:** There is no `POST /api/admin/packages` — packages are created automatically via the Payment route when the package toggle is ON. The existing `POST /api/payments` accepts optional package fields (`isPackage`, `packageName`, `totalSessions`, `expiryDate`, `packageNotes`) and handles both payment creation and package creation in a single atomic `prisma.$transaction()`.

### 16.5 Patient Edit Page (`/admin/patients/:id/edit`)

The patient edit page is focused purely on **editing patient enrollment details** (personal info, contact, program selection, goals). It does **not** include Packages & Visits — that functionality lives in the **Packages & Visits modal** on the Patients list page (Section 16.7), which provides a faster workflow for the doctor.

### 16.6 Integration with Admin Dashboard (`/admin/dashboard`)

Add to the existing stat cards row (Section 13.2):

- **Active Packages** — count of packages with `status: "active"` across all patients
- **Visits Today** — count of visits recorded today (`visitDate = today`)

Add a new section below the existing tables:

- **Packages Needing Attention** — table of packages with ≤ 2 sessions remaining:
  - Columns: Patient Name | Package | Sessions Used | Remaining | Last Visit Date
  - Links to the patient profile page for quick action

### 16.7 Integration with Patients List Page (`/admin/patients`)

Add a new column to the existing patients table (Section 13.3):

- **Package Status** column (after Payment Status):
  - Green badge: "Active (4/10)" — shows active package with progress
  - Blue badge: "Completed" — most recent package was completed
  - Red badge: "Expired (3/10)" — package expired with unused sessions
  - Grey text: "No package" — patient has no packages
  - If multiple active packages, show count: "2 active"

#### Packages & Visits Modal (Quick Visit Entry)

**Clicking the Pkg Status badge** or the **"Visits" action button** opens a full-featured modal overlay directly on the Patients list page. This is the **primary workflow for recording daily visits** — Dr. Neha never needs to navigate away from the patient list.

**Modal layout:**
- **Header:** Package icon + "Packages & Visits" title + patient name & ID + "New Package" button + close (X) button
- **Body (scrollable):** All packages for the patient, sorted by status (active first, then completed, then expired)
- Each package shown as a collapsible card (identical to the EditPatient packages section):
  - Package name + status badge (green/blue/red) + session progress text + receipt number
  - Progress bar showing `visitsDone / totalSessions`
  - Amber alert when ≤2 sessions remaining
  - Expanded detail: start date, expiry, remaining sessions, receipt number
  - **"Mark Visit" button** (active packages only) → inline form with date + treatment notes + Confirm/Cancel
  - Visit log table: Visit # | Date | Notes | Marked By | Delete action
- **Empty state:** "No treatment packages yet" with link to create one via Payment page

**UX benefits over the EditPatient page approach:**
- **Zero navigation** — doctor stays on the patient list, clicks badge, records visit, closes modal
- **Instant context switch** — can immediately move to the next patient without page loads
- **Badge updates in real-time** — after recording a visit, both the modal progress bar and the patient list badge refresh automatically
- **Consistent with clinical workflow** — doctor marks attendance at the start of each session while reviewing the patient list

### 16.8 Quick Visit Entry (Dashboard Shortcut)

Dr. Neha's most common action is recording that a patient showed up today. This should be fast and accessible from the dashboard:

1. **"Mark Visit" quick-action button** on the dashboard (next to existing action buttons)
2. Opens a modal:
   - Patient search (by name, ID, or mobile) — same search as existing patient lookup
   - Once selected, shows the patient's active package(s) with current progress
   - Click **"Mark Visit"** on the relevant package — one click records today's visit
   - Optional: add treatment notes before confirming
3. Modal closes, dashboard "Visits Today" stat updates

### 16.9 Business Rules

- A patient can have **multiple packages** (e.g., one completed, one active)
- A single payment creates **at most one** package (one-to-one relationship)
- Visits cannot exceed `totalSessions` — once all sessions are used, status auto-updates to `completed`
- If `expiryDate` is set and passes before all sessions are used, status auto-updates to `expired` (checked via a daily cron job or on-access check)
- Only admin/staff can record or delete visits
- Visit numbers are sequential per package (not global)
- Package inherits patient and amount info from its linked Payment — no duplicate data entry
- The `program` and `sessionType` from the Patient enrollment are used as defaults when displaying package context (e.g., "Physiotherapy — In-Person")

### 16.10 Patient-Facing View (Optional Future Enhancement)

On the patient's profile or a patient portal (if built), show a read-only view:

- Package name and total sessions
- Sessions completed and remaining
- Dates of all past visits
- Linked payment receipt for reference
